## Usage
For the most basic use, DGT has `dev.deftu.gradle.tools`, which will automatically set up your project metadata and repositories, as well as configuring the Java and Kotlin compilers if their respective plugins are present.

### Resources plugin
The `dev.deftu.gradle.tools.resources` plugin will automatically configure the `processResources` extension in your project, replacing tokens for project metadata, Minecraft metadata and mod metadata.

#### Normal projects
- `project_name`
- `project_version`
- `project_description`
- `project_group`

#### Minecraft mods
- `mod_id`
- `mod_name`
- `mod_version`
- `mod_description`
- `mod_group`
- `file.jarVersion` (For Forge)
- `forge_loader_version` (For Forge)
- `mc_version`
- `minor_mc_version`
- `format_mc_version`
- `java_version`

### Shadow plugin
The `dev.deftu.gradle.tools.shadow` plugin will automatically configure the Shadow plugin in your project, adding a `fatJar` task which is automatically configured to work with Fabric/Architectury Loom (whereas, normal Shadow tasks don't).  
Using it is as simple as applying the plugin to your project and using the `shade` configuration for your dependencies. Be aware that `shade` does not configure the dependency for use in your project, it simply tells Shadow to include it in the JAR.

### Dokka plugin
The `dev.deftu.gradle.tools.dokka` plugin will automatically put your Dokka documentation inside of your Javadoc JAR, and requires nothing more than being applied to your project.
