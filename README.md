This is highly configurable through it's extension.

project, though with it's own drawbacks
and custom configurations as to stop
the user from using the Shadow plugin
itself.

preprocessor buildscript variable checks.
This provides a simple way to check the
current Minecraft mod loader platform and
game version.

most of Fabric and Architectury Loom's plugin
extension for you with few changes needed.
